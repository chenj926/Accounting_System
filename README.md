Inflow and outflow of cash can be manually recorded in accounts with corresponding annotations. The system can generate both real time informal financial records for user interpretation. Correspondingly, automated financial planning will plan the budget provided by the user periodically, notifications will be sent regarding the status of current budget usage.
