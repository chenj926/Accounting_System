# CSC207_Accounting_System
The accounting system will allow users to manage financial records, generate informal financial reports, and ensure compliance with accounting standards. Each user can create a personal account and open multiple financial accounts. Joint accounts allow multiple users to record and plan cash flows in a synchronized account. Inflow and outflow of cash can be manually recorded in accounts with corresponding annotations. The system can generate both real time and monthly informal financial records for user interpretation. Correspondingly, automated financial planning will plan the budget provided by the user periodically, notifications will be sent regarding the status of current budget usage. Import and export features allows users to import their past records, and obtain generated pdf or csv files from their current records.
